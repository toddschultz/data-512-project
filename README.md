# Abstract


# Data source
The data for this project was from Kaggle Datasets dataset of Airline Delays found at https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays released under CC0:Public Domain license. The dataset provides the following introduction. 

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights appears in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, published about 30 days after the month's end, as well as in summary tables posted on this website. The full data files are not provided in this GitHub repo as they exceed the 100 MB file size limit and are readily available on Kaggle Datasets. However, a data file with 100,000 random samples from the full dataset is provided along with support information about the airline and airport codes. 

Thus the original source of the data is the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics and therefore is public domain data and can be found at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/air-travel-consumer-reports. 

# Files included in the project
In the flight-delays folder
* airlines.csv - table mapping the 2 letter IATA airline code to the full airline name
* airports.csv - table mapping the 3 letter IATA airport code to the full airport name, city, state, country and latitude and longitude coordinates
* flightssmall.csv - sample data file with 100,000 random rows from the full data file


Note: the dataset files are not included here as they exceed the file size limit from GitHub. You'll need to download them manually at https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays. 

# Limitations
All of the data was from 2015 and would not capture any improvements made by the airlines or airports.
