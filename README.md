Project goal

Data source
The data for this project was from Kaggle Datasets dataset of Airline Delays found at https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays released under CC0:Public Domain license. The dataset provides the following introduction. 

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights appears in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, published about 30 days after the month's end, as well as in summary tables posted on this website. 

Thus the original source of the data is the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics and therefore is public domain data. 

Files included in the project

Limitations
All of the data was from 2015 and would not capture any improvements made by the airlines or airports.
